Chilitags TUIO Server
=====================

This software is an application sending TUIO messages describing the Chilitags fiducial markers detected by a camera. Its goal is to facilitate the use of Chilitags in any TUIO capable application, even if it is written in a different language than the one used by the Chilitags library (C++). For further information about Chilitags, please visit [Chili's Webpage](http://chili.epfl.ch/software). For further information on the TUIO protocol and framework, please visit [TUIO.org](http://www.tuio.org/).

Dependencies
------------

This software depends on the [chilitags](https://github.com/chili-epfl/chilitags) library and OpenCV's `highgui` and `core` package.


Usage
-----

    chilitags-tuio [x-cam-resolution y-cam-resolution] [camera-index] [host port] [hideFeedback]

*x-cam-resolution y-cam-resolution* are the resolution parameters to give to the camera.
The default resolution is 640x480 pixels.

*camera-index* is the index of the camera to use to detect chilitags.
By default, it is 0, which corresponds to the first camera of the system.
If multiple cameras are attached to the computer, you can select them by increasing this index.

*host port* are the parameters to configure the connection between the tuio server and clients.
The defaults value correspond to the port 3333 on `localhost`.

*hideFeedback* if there is a 6th parameter (any) no video feedback will be shown

Shortcomings
------------

The TUIO messages sent by this software describe chilitags as `2D Objects`, which means that they provide their identifier, position, orientation, speed, acceleration, rotational speed and rotational acceleration.

The TUIO messages do not contain the scale, width and height of the chilitags, even though they would be easily computed. It would be similarly easy to send messages describind the tags in 3D, given that the 3D estimation is built in Chilitags.

You are welcome to manifest your interest in such features, or your own contribution implementing them!
